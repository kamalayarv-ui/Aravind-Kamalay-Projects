To run this project, please make sure that Python 3.10 or above is already installed on your system. It’s better to use a virtual environment so that the required libraries don’t interfere with your system’s global Python installation. Inside the project folder (where all the files like app.py, caption_model.keras, tokenizer.pkl, and run.sh are kept), you can create a virtual environment by running python -m venv venv. After that, you can activate it using venv\Scripts\activate if you're on Windows, or source venv/bin/activate if you're using Linux or Mac.

Once the environment is activated, on Linux or Mac, you can directly run the shell script using the terminal. First, give it execute permission using chmod +x run.sh, and then run ./run.sh. This will install all the required Python packages automatically and start the application. On Windows, you can open a terminal or Command Prompt, and instead of running the .sh file, just manually run the commands written inside it. These include installing the required libraries like tensorflow==2.18.0, keras==3.5.0, numpy==1.26.4, gradio==5.29.0, and pillow==11.1.0 using pip, and finally executing python app.py to launch the application.

Once the app runs successfully, Gradio will automatically open a local web server, usually at http://127.0.0.1:7860. You can open this URL in your browser, upload any image, and the system will instantly generate a caption for it using your trained model. The entire process is user-friendly and should work smoothly if the dependencies are installed properly.
